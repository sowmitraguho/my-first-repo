        <small>Prime Minister Of Bangladesh</small>
        <p>Under her tenure as Prime Minister, Bangladesh has experienced democratic backsliding. The Human Rights Watch
            documented widespread enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings under her government. Many
            politicians and journalists have been systematically and judicially punished for challenging her views. In
            2021, the US has raised questions over the legitimacy of the Sheikh Hasina government over three years after
            the general elections.</p>
